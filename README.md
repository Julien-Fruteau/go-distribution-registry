# go-distribution-registry

A distribution registry client library

Target :

Http Client:

- [x] collect all repositories from the distribution registry

- [ ] inspect on existing tag can lead to (all) layers 404
  - if a tag inspect returns an error layer not found, or all layers not found it is corrupted
  - doing a dry run should look up for this and inform user (user can ensure docker pull does not work), and rebuild image if in use in cluster
  - doing a clean up such tag should anyway be removed in order to be rebuild
- [ ] wip: for all remaining tag, inspect and extract created date
- [ ] remove from the list the N more recent tags

- [ ] wip: for remaining tags, call distribution delete tag

~- [ ] then a registry garbage collect should be called/executed
  NB: since current v2 is buggy, consider doing it manually
  while v3 is officially released~

ðŸ”¥: not direct http call to get the list of all available blobs

File system Client:

- [x] parse filesystem to get all available gzip blobs
  in classic storage :

      1- Recursively scans the blobs directory.
      2- Extracts the digest from the filesystem path.
      3- Prints all available blob SHA256 digests.

```go
 // Approach 3: Using a single []byte (Most Efficient)
 digestsAsSingleSlice := make([]byte, numDigests*32)
 for i := 0; i < numDigests; i++ {
  copy(digestsAsSingleSlice[i*32:(i+1)*32], hash[:])
 }
 fmt.Printf("Memory for single []byte: ~%d MB\n", (len(digestsAsSingleSlice)+int(unsafe.Sizeof(digestsAsSingleSlice)))/(1024*1024))

 // Accessing a digest in the single []byte storage
 index := 10
 start := index * 32
 end := start + 32
 fmt.Printf("Digest at index %d: %x\n", index, digestsAsSingleSlice[start:end])
```
